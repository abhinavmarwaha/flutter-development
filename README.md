Here I meditate about flutter and firebase.

# Why?

* Place to put things I need.
* Learnings -> Don't want to do same mistake twice

# Disclaimer

* Always Refer each package's own repo.
* this is my way of doing things not industry's (hence may not be perfect)
* I update these whenever I find better ways to do things

# I will not add things which are there already

# Roadmap

* widgets - stateless and stateful
* where state - pragmatic aproach -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_m5csmrf7I
* provider
* layouts
* common widgets -> 
* modularity
* structure
*

backend
